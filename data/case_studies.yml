    the_problem: <p>It was difficult to boostrap and to maintain our own CMS.  For our customer, the first issue is to be able to modify their content EFFICIENTLY.</p>
    the_solution: <p>It's easy to propose LocomotiveCMS to our customer after a quick demo of front editing capabilities. And for our team the Wagon is a great tool for maintaining code through Git.</p>
    the_results: <p>Happier customers and efficient coding!</p>
    the_strategy: <p>We use only Ruby language and for us choosing LocomotiveCMS is evident. First we are coding a proto w/ Wagon and providing a demo to our customers, then we improve the AD.</p>
